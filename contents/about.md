Welcome to LasseCash
--

LasseCash is an OUTPOST build by Hive Engine, based on Lasse Ehlers' ideas. We are rewarding anarchy, crypto and truth content.

Proof of brain rewards
--

The basic reward system is "proof of brain" blogging, whereas you can earn LASSECASH / LASSECASH POWER for creating blog posts on LasseCash. We have tweaked the parametres of the Scot.Bot. to be better than Hive and better than competing tribes and OUTPOSTs.

The powerdown time is 26 payments every 7 day over 6 months, this is made to incentivize longterm mentality. Furthermore the payout ratio is 90% LASSECASH POWER and 10% LASSECASH, this is another huge difference from Hive, other tribes and other OUTPOSTs.





Diesel pool rewards
--

If you provide liquidity for the SWAP.HIVE:LASSECASH pool, you will earn Diesel pool rewards. We aim at providing the highest rewards of all pools, at all times. In the beginning that might not be the case, as we are adjusting everything, but pretty soon after implementation, you should get the highest rewards in the whole eco-system of Hive and Hive Engine.

Diesel pool rewards are paid out every day, depending on how much liquidity you provide to the SWAP.HIVE/LASSECASH pool. The share procentage you have of the total liquidity will decide the share of the daily liquidity rewards.

There is a bonus applied for long term liquidity providers. You get 1% extra per day you hold the liquidity in the contract, up till 30 days. If you hold longer then 30 days, you will get 30% extra rewards each day. In other words, when you provide liquidity long term, you get more rewards.


NFT platform
--

LasseCash also enables you to mint your own NFTs. We prefer NFTs that contain or relate to anarchy, crypto and/or truth content, but other themes are also welcomed. You have to apply to be whitelisted and we usualy respond fast. There are terms in place, if you violate those terms you can be blacklisted with no refund. We aim at providing the best NFT platform in the whole cryptocurrency market.

An NFT on LasseCash can be an image, an audio file or a video file. This is quite unique, most other NFT platforms dont provide all three options at the same time.


Dynamic inflation
--

Inflation in LasseCash is decided by Lasse Ehlers, as the leader of the OUTPOST. He aim at only changing the inflation ones a year, but if nessesary it can be done at all times. Changes will always be announced in a post on the blockchain, so there is always full transparency, as there has been since the beginning of this product.

Notes on distribution
--

When you compare LasseCash to any other tribe or OUTPOST, then you will probably see that LasseCash has the smallest amount of tokens. LasseCash also have a hardcap of 51 million LASSECASH ever issued. Those two things together is an advantage that LasseCash has over all other tribes and OUTPOSTs. 



Lasse Ehlers as leader of LasseCash
--

Lasse Ehlers is naturally the leader of the LasseCash OUTPOST and will be the one to resolve any potential dispute or drama, since he will always have the biggest stake.
